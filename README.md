# TuneTalk

## Overview

Discover, rate, and immerse yourself in the world of music with TuneTalk, a album Review Platform, where music lovers unite! Users can create an account, browse albums, submit their own reviews, and rate albums. Each album will have an aggregated rating based on user ratings and a list of user-submitted reviews. This platform aims to foster a music community where users can share their opinions and discover new music through ratings and reviews.

## Data Model

The application will store data for Users, Albums, and Reviews, with relationships between these entities as follows:

- Users can review multiple albums (one-to-many relationship between users and reviews).
- Albums can have multiple reviews from different users (one-to-many relationship between albums and reviews).
- Each Review document references a specific user and album.

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  username: "musiclover123",
  hash: "hashed_password", // password hash
  email: "user@example.com",
  favoriteAlbums: [ObjectId("albumId1"), ObjectId("albumId2")] // references to Album documents
}
```

An Example Album:

```javascript
{
  title: "Abbey Road",
  artist: "The Beatles",
  releaseDate: "1969-09-26",
  genre: "Rock",
  coverImage: "https://example.com/abbey_road.jpg",
  reviews: [ObjectId("reviewId1"), ObjectId("reviewId2")], // references to Review documents
  averageRating: 4.8
}
```

An Example Review:

```javascript
{
  user: ObjectId("userId"), // reference to a User object
  album: ObjectId("albumId"), // reference to an Album object
  rating: 5,
  comment: "An all-time classic. Every song is iconic!",
  createdAt: "2024-10-01T10:00:00Z" // timestamp
}
```
